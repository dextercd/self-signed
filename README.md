# Self-signed

Web application for generating self-signed certificates.

It's more convenient than command-line tools, since it works the same no matter what platform you're on (Window/Linux/MacOS).

Compared to most other websites with similar functionality, this site generates the keys on the client side, which means you don't have to worry about anyone else seeing them.

The certificates generated by this tool are meant to work when imported in most major platform trust stores, e.g., Windows/Linux/MacOS or program specific ones like in Firefox.
